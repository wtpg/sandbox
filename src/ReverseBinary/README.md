# Reversed Binary Numbers
(Difficulty Level: Easy)
ProblemID: Reversebinary

## Task
Your task will be to write a program for reversing numbers in binary. For instance, the binary representation of 13 is 1101, and reversing it gives 1011, which corresponds to number 11.

## Input
The input contains a single line with an integer N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000.

## Output
Output one line with one integer, the number we get by reversing the binary representation of N.
